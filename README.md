# Instance Segmentation Model README

This repository contains an instance segmentation model with the following features:

- **Precise Instance Segmentation**: Our model accurately identifies and delineates individual objects within images, providing pixel-level segmentation masks for each instance.

- **Fast and Efficient**: Powered by Detectron2, our solution leverages efficient backbone architectures for real-time or near-real-time instance segmentation without compromising accuracy.

- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Our user-friendly web interface allows you to upload your images and instantly see the results of instance segmentation, making it accessible to both experts and newcomers in the field.

- **Interactive Visualization**: Explore and interact with the segmented images using our intuitive visualization tools. Toggle between original and segmented views to understand the model's performance better.

- **Customizable**: Tailor the instance segmentation model to your specific use case by fine-tuning it on your dataset. Our platform provides guides and resources to help you adapt the model effectively.

- **Scalable Deployment**: Whether you're working on a personal project or an enterprise-level application, our model can be seamlessly integrated into your workflow with our deployment guides.
