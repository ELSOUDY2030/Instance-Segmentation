# Instance Segmentation Tooth Dentistry

This project employs the Mask R-CNN model to perform instance segmentation specifically for dental applications within the field of dentistry. With this model, it becomes possible to recognize and delineate individual teeth along with assessing their conditions, including but not limited to implants, root canals, and crowns, using dental X-ray images. This comprehensive README offers insights into the project, its configuration, and potential applications.
